# Skin-condition-classification-CNN
This convolutional neural-network is an experimental Software to classify the existence of certain skin diseases (Usage at your own risk - Functionality not clinically proven).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objective of Software:

Detection of certain skin diseases through a Convolutional neural network. Skin diseases which are detectable are: 

-acne and Rosacea

-skincancer

-Eczema

-Psoriasis

-Actinic Keratosis

-Nail Fungus

-Tinea Ringworm

-Seborrheic Keratoses

(Search the terms at your own risk)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Result of Project:

Is able to detect all 8 skin diseases with 80% accuracy. Can't seperate healthy from sick skin (Should only be used for already supected parts of skin).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Future plans:

-addition of healthy skin to the dataset

-addition of more skin disease types to the dataset
